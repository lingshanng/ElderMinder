Problem: Forgetfulness is common for the elderly and it disrupts their daily life. It could bring serious consequences when for instance they forget take their medicine. Many are inept with technology so they are unable to use many of the complicated apps already available. 

Solution: Alarm/Notification app designed for the elderly. It is simple to use, while containing more advanced features to allow caregivers to create more detailed alarms/reminders. Reminders come in many forms which include audio, picture and text to account for the elderly who are illiterate.
